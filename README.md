# Problem Set 02

These problems are to challenge your basic knowledge in working with arrays,
different data types and mutable data in various scenarios.

## Setup

1. Download this practice from GitHub.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `mocha` to run all specs.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem so that all specs are passing.

These problems entail the following challenges as the primary objectives:

- `myIncludes()`: searching for a target within an array.
- `maxValue()`: determining a maximum value based on an input array.
- `avgVal()`: determining an average value based on an input array.
- `additionMutator()`: modifying integer values of an input array.
- `alternatingWords()`: modifying string values of an input array.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-my-includes.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `mocha test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `mocha test/01-my-includes-spec.js`

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
